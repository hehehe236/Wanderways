# Delivery Client

This project is a B2C/P2P delivery service built using React and Redux. The main idea is to provide a platform where users can quickly find reliable and independent drivers to deliver goods and parcels anywhere within a short period. The service ensures the reliability of carriers, timely notifications, and optional insurance for shipments. Business clients can also use the service for their logistics needs without maintaining their own fleet of vehicles and drivers.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux**: A predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
